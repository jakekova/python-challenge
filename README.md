# python-challenge

Using python, my task is to write two scripts with the given data sets.

In PyBank and using budget_data.csv, the task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

 - The total number of months included in the dataset
 - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
 - The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
 - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
 - The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

In PyPoll and using election_data.csv, the task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

 - The total number of votes cast
 - A complete list of candidates who received votes
 - The percentage of votes each candidate won
 - The total number of votes each candidate won
 - The winner of the election based on popular vote

Each set of results prints in the console as well as exports to a analysis.txt file in the analysis folder.

Data for this dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC.
